# #30DaysofFLCode Challenge!

<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gc2CPgAbEAEkLzG?format=jpg"/>

[OpenMined](https://openmined.org/) has recently started the [#30DaysOfFLCode Challenge](https://30DaysOfFLCode.com) to learn about Federated Learning and Privacy Enhancing Techniques (PETs). 

What's exciting is that I have publicly committed to the challenge starting *November 20* as a sponsored participant by OpenMined itself! See my public statement here: [Twitter Post](https://x.com/StarOrion25/status/1859285718042079300). The rules are simple:

**Rule 1:**
- Publicly commit to the challenge.
- Hold yourself accountable by making a public statement saying you intend to participate in the challenge.

**Rule 2:**
- Study Federated Learning for 1 hour/day for 30 days.
- Access free resources, tutorials, and community support to enhance your skills. OpenMined provides some, while you explore and discover others on your own.

**Rule 3:**
- Post daily updates on social media using **#30DaysOfFLCode** and engage with other participants on social media and in the slack community.

> At the end of succesfully completing the challenge, I not only would've gathered a great wealth of knowledge, but would also receive a $1000 stipend. Wait, what? I'm getting paid to learn?? Sweet!

Hence, below is my plan for the next 30 days, hopefully filled with a lot of learning, expanding my knowledge, hand-on skill development, all leading to hopefully better prospects for the future. 
At the very least, the AI privacy and risk community would've grown by a solid, high-quality 100 members and the world would eventually be a better place ðŸ™‚.
